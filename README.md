## Technologies Used

Auth0, Axios, Express, Mongoose, React, React Calendar, React Beautiful Drag n Drop, React Bootstrap, React Router, React Scripts, Socket IO.

## Usage

This project is designed to combine a communication tool with a Kanban tool. In order to increase efficiency among teams, this project aims to reduce the need to switch between applications and allow teams to use a one stop shop for their project needs.

Users will be prompted with a signin popup window using Auth0. Once users have successfully signed in using social media, or a local db account, they will be taken to the project splash page. Here they will see a Kanban with various tasks added by team members complete with title and description. These tasks can be moved around the columns which are labeled to-do, in progress, and done. When they are moved in the columns, the tasks are updated in the database so it persists through reloads.

Additionally users will see a deadline bar to the right of the Kanban. This feature sorts all the tasks by deadline date and allows users to quickly see what needs to be completed and when that task is due.

Finally, this project features a chat system that is specific to the project. Users can click the chat button and speak with team members without having to switch applications.

## Project Status

This project achieves it's MVP, but there are many goals for this project in the future.

Features we'd like to implement:
The ability to have multiple projects, each with their own tasks, deadline bar, and chat system.

The ability to implement a video chat system, combining project management tools, chat, and video in one application.
